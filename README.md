### Hi there 👋, I'm Premtim Sahitaj, a PhD student at the Technical University of Berlin. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on fake news detection from different perspectives such a knowledge-based reasoning or the syntheziation of (partially) fradulent news.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things at once. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects with multimodals language models for different domains. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/premsa/premsa/issues).
